# DeepHit-for-credit-scoring

In this repository, I provide my code written within the scope of the publication on deep learning for time-to-event analysis in a credit scoring setting for the Journal of the Operational Research Society (JORS). Please note that only the experiments performed with the deep learning model "DeepHit" are provided here. All statistical and random forest benchmark experiments were performed in R and will not be published here.
